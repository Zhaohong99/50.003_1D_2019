# Project README

### Project Requirements
Implement a web application that acts as a support ticket system for the APIs available for consumption under Accenture.
1. The system should allow users to submit important information such as images, details, contact, etc.
2. Web app UI should be intuitive for administrators and users
3. Administrators should be able to respond to, retrieve and manage tickets
4. Notification capabilities such as SMS alerts and email integration
5. Non Code: Pitch deck for marketing their solution, documentation for web app and backend system for handover
6. Bonus: Real-time chat functionality



### Questions
1. May we have a sample of the tickets the system should be prepared for?
2. Which kind of email should the system be integrated with?
3. For ease of handover, any preferred web servers and databases?
4. What is 'manage tickets'?
5. Any requirements for UI style?
6. Will the tickets be created by users or automatically created through the API itself?
7. How should we be retrieving tickets? Will viewing tickets be considered as retrieval?
8. Would having a history of resolved tickets be necessary or an extension of the project requirements?
9. Can the priority of tickets be changed by users, administrators, the backend program of the web app or all three?
